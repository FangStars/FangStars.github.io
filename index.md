## About Me

I am a 2nd-year PhD student at Xiamen University's [SNGroup](https://sngroup.org.cn/), 
under the guidance of Professor [Qiao Xiang](https://qiaoxiang.me/). 
I earned my master degree in computer technology from Institute of Information Engineering, 
Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2022, under the guidance of [Bo Hu](https://teacher.ucas.ac.cn/~0057576).
Prior to this, I received my BEng degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2019.

## Research Interests

My main research interest focuses on the computer network and formal methods, aiming to ensure 
that the computer network operates as intended.

Recently, I have been trying to develop an innovative technique to accelerate control plane verification. 
Besides, I am also highly interested in exploring new techniques of network error
diagnosis and repair and privacy-preserving network verification.

## News

- **[Dec. 2023]** Our paper about incremental control plane verification is accepted to INFOCOM 2024.
