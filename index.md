I am also a research intern at Alibaba Cloud (since April 2024), co-advised by Fangdan Ye and [Ennan Zhai](https://ennanzhai.github.io/).
I earned my master degree in computer technology from the Institute of Information Engineering, 
Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2022, under the guidance of [Bo Hu](https://teacher.ucas.ac.cn/~0057576).
Prior to this, I received my BEng degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2019.

## Research Interests

My main research interests lie at the intersection of computer networks and formal methods, with the goal of ensuring that networks operate as intended.

Recently, my research has focused on enhancing configuration verification tools to achieve higher accuracy and broader coverage.

I am also interested in configuration verification acceleration, network error diagnosis and repair, and privacy-preserving network verification.
